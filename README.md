Follow along with the online paid course on [DataCamp presented by Kevin Markham](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/analyzing-police-activity-with-pandas?irclickid=QMCwVk0QHzO8We1WeX2xP32SUkA1XCUG4y9PyI0&irgwc=1&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact&utm_campaign=000000_1-2850254_2-mix_3-all_4-na_5-na_6-na_7-mp_8-affl-ip_9-na_10-bau_11-Data%20School&utm_content=ONLINE_TRACKING_LINK)

During this course many topics were covered using two datasets - one for the police stops in Rhode Island and the other for weather conditions during that period.

Concepts that I managed to cover and understand after completing the course are the following:
* importing and cleaning data
* dealing with NaN/null values
* analyzing data
* calculating percentage values for columns
* visual data analysis
* dealing with DateTimeIndex
* using matplotlib to showcase simple visual representation of data
* resampling data
* sublopts for simultaneous graphic representations of different columns with different value scales
* trying different kind of plots in matplotlib (line chart, bar chart, barh, stacked bars, histograms...)
* merging dataframes on one common column
* using categories instead of strings for ordinal values and memory efficency
* creating MultiIndexed Series and using unstack() function on them to transform them into DataFrames
* using pivot_table function to get the same result as when unstacking MultiIndexed Series etc.
